# Logistic Regression Model with 2015 BRFSS Survey Data

This project demonstrates the implementation of a logistic regression model using only NumPy to fit data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey Data. Logistic regression is utilized here for binary classification tasks.

## Introduction

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual, state-based telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The 2015 BRFSS dataset contains information related to various health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.

## Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model using NumPy to predict or analyze a binary outcome or response variable based on the features present in the 2015 BRFSS Survey Data.

## Dataset

The 2015 BRFSS Survey Data is available from the CDC's official website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2015.html). The dataset contains numerous features and responses related to health behaviors and conditions.

### Data Preprocessing

Before applying the logistic regression model, the data undergoes preprocessing steps including:

- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Feature selection or extraction to identify the most relevant variables for the model.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Methodology

This project uses logistic regression, a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The implementation is solely done using NumPy to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the algorithm.

### Dependencies

The project primarily relies on the following libraries:

- NumPy: For mathematical operations and implementation of logistic regression.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `data/`: Directory containing the BRFSS Survey Data.
- `logistic_regression.py`: Python script implementing the logistic regression model using NumPy.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (the current file).
- Other necessary supporting files or documentation.

## Usage

To run the logistic regression model:

1. Download the 2015 BRFSS Survey Data from the provided link and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Execute the `logistic_regression.py` script.

## Results

Results and model performance metrics will be displayed or saved within the script upon running the logistic regression model. These may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.
